# Tornado

Goal: make tornadoes out of particles with interesting behaviours

## TODO

- CODE CLEANUP!!!
- make the camera pan
- add particle trail
- add lighting?
- add a floor?

## DONE

- tornadoes are made out of particles
- tornadoes have a rotation speed, a height, a position and a hue
- particles can have slightly off speed from their tornado, this affect the hue too
- the height of a tornado affects the amount of particles
- the tornado's shape is somewhat curved, not just a cone
- particles are affected by perlin noise, it is stronger the lower it is. This somewhat ressembles a tornado. Can be improved
- tornadoes can spin either way and can be moved, there can be more than one tornado
- strokeWeight changes based on z
- tornadoes move using perlin noise
- added tornado collision with invisible walls and other tornadoes
